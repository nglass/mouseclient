MouseClient is an unofficial Java client for Mobile Mouse Server from RPA Tech. It allows you to use your laptop as a wireless keyboard and mouse to control a media PC/Mac from across the room.

MouseClient supports sending:

- Keyboard input
- Mouse button and motion events
- Mouse wheel
- Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to zoom.

Usage
When MouseClient launches a dialog will be displayed to select the Mobile Mouse Server that you would like to connect to. Either select from the list or enter IP address and port number manually.

Once logged in the MouseClient window displays no further controls. Clicking on the window will cause further mouse and keyboard events to be sent to the server machine. Pressing "Ctrl + ~", will return control to your local machine.
